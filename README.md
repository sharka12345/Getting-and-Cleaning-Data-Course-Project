Preliminaries

The script checks if the required library reshape2 is loaded, and loads it if not.

1. Reading of Data

Data are read from the files:

Data: X_test and X_train (data)
Activity Data: y_test and y_train (activity_data)
Subject Data: subject_test and subject_train (subject_data)
Labels: labels
Features: features

2. Extract of Mean and Standard Deviation Data

Vector of mean and sd created from column 2 of features using grep (msd)
data reduced to only mean and sd by application of msd

3. and 4.

data names cleaned using gsub
Subject and Activity labels added to subject_data and activity_data

5. Grouping and Tidy Data

Use of melt from reshape2 to group data and add activity labels
Write tidied data to "tidied_averag_data.txt"
